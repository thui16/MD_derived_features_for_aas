# Molecular dynamics (MD)-derived features for amino acids
This repository is where you can find the features for amino acids used in our manuscript "Molecular dynamics (MD)-derived features for amino acids". We also include Python code that can encode peptide sequences using our features, as well as code that can generate features for new amino acids given a user's MD trajectory data.
